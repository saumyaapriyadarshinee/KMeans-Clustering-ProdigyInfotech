## 📘 Project Overview

The project demonstrates the use of the **K-Means clustering algorithm** to group data points based on feature similarity. The workflow includes:

- Dataset loading and exploration  
- Data preprocessing (normalization, handling missing values if applicable)  
- Feature selection  
- Determining the optimal number of clusters using:
  - Elbow Method  
  - Inertia analysis  
- Implementation of K-Means clustering  
- Visualization of clusters using Matplotlib/Seaborn  
- Interpretation of cluster formation and separation
